# ☕ Starbucks Customer Feedback Analysis using NLP & LDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to analyse unstructured Starbucks customer reviews and transform them into actionable business insights. By automating topic discovery at scale, the solution helps identify key customer concerns such as service quality, wait times, and staff management, supporting data-driven decision-making for customer experience improvement.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyse large volumes of unstructured customer feedback  
- Identify dominant and emerging topics using LDA topic modeling  
- Track how customer concerns evolve over time  
- Support managerial decision-making with intuitive visualisations  

## 🧠 Methodology
The analysis follows an end-to-end NLP pipeline:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Text normalisation, stopword removal, lemmatisation  
   - Handling missing values and date conversion  
2. **Exploratory Text Analysis**  
   - Word frequency analysis  
   - Sentiment categorisation  
   - Review length analysis  
3. **Text Visualisation**  
   - Word clouds  
   - N-grams (bigrams & trigrams)  
   - Temporal trend analysis  
4. **Topic Modeling**  
   - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using scikit-learn  
   - Topic interpretation and business labelling  
   - Topic trend analysis over time  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn  
- **NLP Techniques:** LDA, n-grams, tokenisation, lemmatisation  
- **Visualisation:** matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customer feedback is dominated by concerns around **service quality, wait times, and staff management**  
- Negative reviews are more frequent and detailed than positive ones  
- Topic trends reveal persistent operational challenges and shifting customer priorities over time  

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations
- Customer data privacy and anonymisation  
- Potential bias in automated topic interpretation  
- Importance of transparency and human oversight in AI-driven insights  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate sentiment analysis with topic modeling  
- Deploy real-time dashboards for continuous feedback monitoring  
- Expand analysis to multiple brands or platforms
